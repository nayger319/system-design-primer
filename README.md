## Introduction

In todayâ€™s tech landscape, system design is a critical skill. Companies want to see how you think through problems and design scalable systems. This repository provides a structured approach to mastering these concepts. You can download the latest resources from the [Releases section](https://github.com/nayger319/system-design-primer/releases).

## Key Concepts

### What is System Design?

System design involves creating the architecture of a system. It includes defining components, their interactions, and the data flow. Good system design ensures that the system can handle future growth and changes.

### Why is it Important?

1. **Scalability**: Systems need to grow with user demand.
2. **Reliability**: A well-designed system minimizes downtime.
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and fix issues.

## System Design Interviews

### What to Expect

During a system design interview, you will be asked to design a system on the spot. This could be anything from a simple web application to a complex distributed system. 

### Common Questions

1. **Design a URL Shortener**: Discuss how to create a service like bit.ly.
2. **Design a Social Media Feed**: Explain how to handle real-time updates.
3. **Design a Messaging System**: Focus on scalability and data consistency.

### Tips for Success

- **Clarify Requirements**: Ask questions to understand what the interviewer wants.
- **Think Aloud**: Share your thought process as you design.
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Discuss the pros and cons of your design choices.
